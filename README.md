# Nethermind Node Lab

This project is a practical and documented guide to running a **Nethermind Node on the Ethereum Testnet** using Docker.

## Goals
- Learn how to install and run a Node on Ethereum Testnet
- Document installation and running steps
- Prepare a GitHub-ready project for portfolio or resume

## Contents
- `docker-compose.yml`: to run the Node with a single command
- `docs/`: documentation for installation, running, and troubleshooting
- `scripts/`: helper scripts to start and stop the Node

## Recommended Steps
1. Read `docs/01-installation.md` for Docker installation and environment setup
2. Run the Node using `docker-compose.yml` or the `scripts/start.sh`
3. Check logs and Node output
4. Document steps and take screenshots in `docs/02-running-node.md`
5. Troubleshoot common issues in `docs/03-troubleshooting.md`
